## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- You need a C++ compiler to build and run this program. If you don't have one installed, you can download [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/index.html) for various platforms.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   git clone : [(https://github.com/Sachin-Mhetre/Chess_Game/blob/main/Chess_Game.cpp)]

## Usage
- Start the program, and you'll see the chessboard displayed in the console.
- Enter your moves following the standard algebraic notation (e.g., "e2 to e4").
- Enjoy playing chess!

## How to Play
- Players take turns to make moves.
- To make a move, specify the current position of the piece and the destination position (e.g., "e2 to e4").
- The game will enforce the rules of chess, so you don't need to worry about illegal moves.

## Game Rules
- This program follows standard chess rules, including castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
- The game detects checkmate and stalemate conditions.
- If a player's king is in checkmate, the game ends, and the opponent wins.
